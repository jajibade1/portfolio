          Welcome to my portfolio website. Here I will demonstrate my web development background and programming knowledge via small projects and tasks I have completed. I would like to improve on my web development skills by creating websites and improve my knowledge of programming in Java, Node, Angular JS, HTML, CSS, C# and C++ as well as other technologies.
          I have a BSc degree in information technology as a practitioner. I managed to achieve a first class honours degree at Coventry University. I have always enjoyed using computers and learning to program. I have managed to complete various projects within university and outside of my studies I have designed programs in C++ and C#. I have also completed a sample shopping website using HTML, CSS.

    <h4>App Inventor tutorial</h4>

    <p class="Review">
       This was a application I designed for a phone which was a quiz. It enabled the user to select the correct answer and it enabled the user to change the colour, text size and included text to speech function. In addtion, I was able to create different level varying from easy to hard. It would caluclate the amount of questions you got right and wrong.

<h4>Web shopping website</h4>

<p class="Review">
This is a website I designed in HTML and CSS. It was a shopping website which enabled the users to select products from the images and it would calculate the total. It enabled the user to remove or add products to the basket.
